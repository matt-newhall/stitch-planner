# To Do List and Habits Tracker

Habit tracker (annoyingly) slightly inspired through reading Atomic Habits, but I wanted to expand it a little bit to encompass digitising my to-do list, and having it next to my habit tracker seemed like the easiest way to get myself to do both!

This is my first attempt at a vibe-coded project using the latest React Native + Zustand for local async storage + React Navigation (mostly to see what the alternatives were to @wix/react-native-navigation from Beryl, which I hate!).

## Setup

To run locally:

```bash
yarn start
```

Any issues with cache, whack a `--clear` flag on that and it should be fine.

Tests run on Jest + React Testing Library, and can be run with:

```bash
yarn test
```
